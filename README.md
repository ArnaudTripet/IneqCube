neqCube is a sample selection method based on the application of the cube method (JC Deville & Y Till√©, 2004) with inequality constraints. This method is designed for spatial sampling and other applications, which will be elaborated on shortly. The primary R file, labeled "Supplementary Material," contains the complete method along with toy examples to demonstrate its functionality. Additional files focus specifically on spatial sampling scenarios.

Work is in progress to refine the algorithms and enhance their efficiency, ensuring that IneqCube meets diverse sampling needs effectively.
